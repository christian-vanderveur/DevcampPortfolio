        <p>My path to full stack web development, altough difficult and new, has been one of the best decisions I've ever made. Starting when I worked in the construction industry which supplies you with no shortage of monotonous yet necessary tasks to be fulfilled, all of which I was constantly seeking ways to make easier or even automate. Doing so taught me several valuble lessons, not the least of which being the very core of human technology and programming: to make simpler (easier, shorter, faster, more accesable, etc..).</p>

        <p>After my career in construction I started searching for what I wanted to do perminently, deciding that Nursing would be interesting and I would find fulfillment there. I sought out a job as a Nurses Assistant (NA) and was thrown straight into the healthcare industry, caring for the eldery and disabled, which I have to add, I was completely and utterly unprepared for. I was thrown as a NA into the deep end given anywhere from 10-18 individuals who had legitimate needs that had to be met, in both a timely and quality manner, which, however painful at the time, I am immensely grateful for now. I desperately wanted to quit seeing as I had no clue what I was doing and there was no one to hold my hand through it, however it was something that I commited to, so I stuck with it, even starting school and becoming a Certified Nurses Assistant on my way to a Registered Nurse.</p>

        <p>During my time as a CNA and Nursing student some of my friends who knew a bit about programming suggested that I check it out, so I found a few online resources and started teaching myself. After finishing a few of those courses I knew it was something I wanted to commit to perminently; that same week I started looking through schools and courses to teach me more and give me guidance. I went with an accelerated full time course with over 600 hours of in class work and have been coding and learning everyday since.</p>
